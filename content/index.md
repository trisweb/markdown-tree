Localytics Product Design Markdown Repository
=============================================

What is it?
-----------
We like Markdown. We enjoy writing things in Markdown and just sticking them in
Dropbox. This is a pretty easy way to take notes, document, specify, or do pretty much any
other type of communication using structured language.

However, we still want a nice way to present and view these simple Markdown files, and
share them with others. Enter markdown-tree. It uses the excellent Redcarpet markdown parser
(the same one github uses) and renders them with styles derived from Github's markdown CSS.

Nice! Best of both worlds. Easy dropbox standard file editing, and nice presentation and sharing.
